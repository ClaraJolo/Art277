    <h2><span style="color:orange">“Fully vaccinated”</span> <span style="color:green;">doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</span></h2>

</video>“Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations
and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of
being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”
     <p>

     <h2><span style="color: orange;">Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to
others, including other vaccinated people?</h2>

    <p>“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”</p>
